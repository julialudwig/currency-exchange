# Currency Exchange
This program uses a simulated currency exchange service that never changes values in order to exchange a value between two currencies, as well as a python script and testing application.
Code was written in collaboration with a partner, mentioned as author in the specifications where applicable.
Thorough test cases are written in a1test.py, a script to run the program in a1app.py, and a1.py holds the necessary functions.
This code uses the introcs package, available at https://github.com/WalkerWhite/introcs-python.
